## üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup

---

To get PathGen AI up and running on your local machine, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/pathgen-ai.git](https://github.com/your-username/pathgen-ai.git)
    cd pathgen-ai
    ```

    *(Remember to replace `your-username` with your actual GitHub username and `pathgen-ai.git` with your repository name.)*

2.  **Set up the Python environment:**
    It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    *(You'll need to create a `requirements.txt` file in your project's root directory. This file should list all your Python dependencies, such as `Flask`, `FastAPI`, `requests`, etc.)*

3.  **Run the backend server:**

    ```bash
    python app.py  # Or whatever your main Python file is named
    ```

    *(The server will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or a similar address. Check your Python script for the exact port and address.)*

4.  **Open the frontend:**
    Navigate to the `index.html` file in your browser, or if your Python backend serves the frontend, simply open the URL provided by the backend server (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000`).

## üí° Usage

---

Once the application is running, it's incredibly easy to use:

1.  Open your web browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the address where your server is running).
2.  Enter your desired career path (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer", "AI Engineer", "UX Designer") into the input field.
3.  Click the **"Generate Roadmap"** button.
4.  Your personalized roadmap will then be dynamically displayed on the page, beautifully outlining the key steps and recommended resources for your journey!
