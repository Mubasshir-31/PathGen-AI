üõ†Ô∏è Installation & Setup
To get PathGen AI up and running on your local machine, follow these steps:

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/pathgen-ai.git
cd pathgen-ai

(Replace your-username with your actual GitHub username and pathgen-ai.git with your repository name)

Set up the Python environment:
It's recommended to use a virtual environment.

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
pip install -r requirements.txt

(You will need to create a requirements.txt file in your project's root directory listing all Python dependencies, e.g., Flask, requests, etc.)

Run the backend server:

python app.py  # Or whatever your main Python file is named

(The server will typically run on http://127.0.0.1:5000 or a similar address. Check your Python script for the exact port.)

Open the frontend:
Navigate to the index.html file in your browser, or if your Python backend serves the frontend, simply open the URL provided by the backend server (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:5000).

üí° Usage
Once the application is running, open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 (or the address where your server is running).

Enter the desired career path (e.g., "Full-Stack Developer", "AI Engineer", "UX Designer") into the input field.

Click the "Generate Roadmap" button.

The personalized roadmap will be displayed on the page, outlining the key steps and resources.
